# MediaScript.js
The MediaScript of NotSoBot, but built from scratch. 
This time, without the limitations of 150 lines of maximum code or the maximum waiting time of 30 seconds, and without weight or frame manipulation limits. 
Unlike NotSoBot, which operates on a server where commands are downloaded and uses FFMPEG and ImageMagik for editing, considering the file limits of Discord.
MediaScript.js needs to be installed and works with `fluent-ffmpeg` and Node.JS.

## Instructions

MediaScript.js requires Node.JS v20.13.1, and the following libraries:
```
fluent-ffmpeg
```

This can be installed by running `npm install fluent-ffmpeg`.

It also requires the command line utility `ffmpeg`.

-# use as a basis for the README.md, the README.md of Stammer.py, because English is not my native language and I also don't know how to create instructions from scratch.
